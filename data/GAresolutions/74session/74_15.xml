          <p xml:space="preserve">	We welcome efforts made by landlocked developing countries to enhance their participation in global trade, including through mainstreaming trade into their national strategies and updating their trade-related policies. However, we note that landlocked developing countries continue to face greater difficulties than coastal countries in expanding international trade. The competitiveness of landlocked developing countries remains limited owing to the high cost of trade, which is double that of transit developing countries. In that regard, we note with concern that the share of landlocked developing countries in global trade has declined and their share of global merchandise exports has decreased, while the total value of merchandise imports has increased.</p>
