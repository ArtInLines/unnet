# unnet - UN Network Analysis

Network analysis on resolutions passed by the UN

## Quickstart

1. Download or clone this repository
2. From inside this directory, run `python unnet.py`

## Development

Type annotations are used to statically typecheck all code.
To typecheck the code, make sure you have mypy installed (otherwise run `python -m pip install mypy`) and run `mypy unnet.py --check-untyped-defs`
